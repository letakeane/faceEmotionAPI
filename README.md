# faceEmotionAPI - currently **IN PROGRESS**

The faceEmotionAPI provides a dataset of images of human faces (gathered via google searches for images marked "for reuse with modification"), along with relevant alt text, a human-identified primary emotion, and basic demographic information of the subject in each image (age, race, gender).

The API is a RESTful API.
